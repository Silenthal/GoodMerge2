# GoodMerge2
Fork of the SourceForge project GoodMerge which has been unmaintained since 2009


GoodMerge can be found at http://goodmerge.sourceforge.net/.  If you want to know what it is go there.

In its day GoodMerge was used and appreciated but it's gone without an official update for about a decade now.  It throws fits when using the latest 7zip in some non-critical cases and the XMDBs are out of date.  I have no intention of adopting this project long term but I am going to fix a few of the bugs that are annoying me, tighten up some error checking, and update the XMDBs.  After that it can be forked at whim and hopefully someone will keep it maintained.
